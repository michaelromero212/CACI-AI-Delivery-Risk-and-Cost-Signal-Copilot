WEEKLY STATUS REPORT - PROJECT LYNX
Date: 2025-01-05
Program Manager: Tom Williams

SUMMARY:
The program remains Green on schedule but Yellow on technical due to edge latency hurdles. Algorithm team has achieved 92% accuracy on signal classification in lab environments.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
1. Successfully integrated the new Jetson Orin AGX modules into the field test kits.
2. Drafted the tactical data link encryption protocol for NSA review.
3. Completed the first phase of "Mission-in-the-Loop" simulation for SIGINT targeting.

PENDING ISSUES:
- Edge latency for real-time classification is currently at 65ms, exceeding the 50ms threshold requirement.
- Awaiting final clearance updates for three junior data scientists joining the team in February.

UPCOMING MILESTONES:
- Field test alpha at Fort Bragg scheduled for Jan 20th.
- Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the SIGINT AI pipeline on Feb 5th.
