MISSION CLOUD MODERNIZATION - WEEKLY STATUS
Date: 2025-01-05
Program Manager: Sarah Chen

SUMMARY:
Mission Cloud is currently Yellow due to Azure GovCloud ATO delays and unexpected egress costs. Deployment to Tactical Edge nodes is currently in the integration lab.

PROGRESS:
1. Completed migration of the "Aegis Data Pipeline" to Azure Secret.
2. Successfully tested disconnected sync for tactical tablet clients with 95% efficiency.
3. Automated 80% of the landing zone security controls via Terraform.

BLOCKERS:
- ATO approval for the production Secret environment is pending ISSO signatures.
- High egress charges observed in Dec due to inefficient data replication strategies; refactoring in progress.

NEXT STEPS:
- Demo "Tactical Sync" feature to Navy stakeholders on Jan 15th.
- Finalize cost optimization plan to reduce data transfer overhead.
